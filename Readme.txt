Thanks for Downloading my first script: (Jerry Blackwell#5070)
Credits to 12LetterMeme#0001 for his NUI and some client elements making all of the animations work together.
The Script currently supports 3 webhooks, for 3 different Picture channels (PD / CID / PI)
This can be used for different Police Departments if you so wish to edit them, the easiset way would be to just edit the Item names to your liking making sure
the webhooks match up to the correct one.

Items:
[

		["pdcamera"]					= { ["name"] = "pdcamera", 			["label"] = "1st Camera", 						["weight"] = 1000, 		["type"] = "item", 		["image"] = "camera.png", 			["unique"] = true, 		["useable"] = true, 	["shouldClose"] = true, ["combinable"] = nil, ["description"] = "DSLR Camera, with cloud uplink.. cool right?"},
		["cidcamera"]					= { ["name"] = "cidcamera", 			["label"] = "2nd Camera", 						["weight"] = 1000, 		["type"] = "item", 		["image"] = "camera.png", 			["unique"] = true, 		["useable"] = true, 	["shouldClose"] = true, ["combinable"] = nil, ["description"] = "DSLR Camera, with cloud uplink.. cool right?"},
		["picamera"]					= { ["name"] = "picamera", 			["label"] = "3rd Camera", 						["weight"] = 1000, 		["type"] = "item", 		["image"] = "camera.png", 			["unique"] = true, 		["useable"] = true, 	["shouldClose"] = true, ["combinable"] = nil, ["description"] = "DSLR Camera, with cloud uplink.. cool right?"},


Change the Label to anything you want!
